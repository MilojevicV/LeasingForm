# LeasingForm
 Form in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS made to calculate Leasing details based on input
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:
- Added an error message that displays if inputs are not populated
- Leasing details are calculated correctly as by business rules
- In the "SIDE NOTE" part are things that I have changed, that weren't in the business rules.

SIDE NOTE:
- In the business rules "Leasing period (Months)" has a range input, but in the sample image it doesn't.
- This may be a mistake, but I decided to remove the range input as it looks a lot more user friendly for that input specifically.
- I also took the liberty of centering the text (Leasing details) on smaller screens as I thought it looked better than it being glued to the left side of the form.
- By those changes, the form looks and behaves exactly like it does in the example pictures.
